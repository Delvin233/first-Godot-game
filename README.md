# 🍄 First Godot Game – A Mario‑Style Platformer

A beginner-friendly platformer built using the **Godot Engine**. Inspired by classic side‑scrollers like *Super Mario Bros.*, this project demonstrates basic platforming mechanics: movement, gravity, collision, collectibles, enemies, and level transitions.

## 🔧 Project Structure

```
first-Godot-game/
├── assets/         # Images, sprites, sounds, music
├── scenes/         # .tscn scene files (levels, player, enemies, UI)
├── scripts/        # GDScript files for behavior
├── .gitignore
└── project.godot   # Godot project file
```

* **`scenes/`**:

  * `Player.tscn` & `player.gd`: handles movement, jumping, collision
  * `Enemy.tscn` & `enemy.gd`: basic AI patrol and collisions
  * `MainLevel.tscn`: core gameplay
  * `Level2.tscn`, etc.: add more levels as you go

* **`assets/`**: tilemaps, sprites, SFX & music

* **`scripts/`**: contains GDScript logic for gameplay mechanics

## 🧱 Extending the Game

Here are some ideas to expand the project:

* Add **power-ups** (speed boost, invincibility)
* Design **UI screens** (menu, pause, game over)
* Incorporate **animations** for characters and enemies
* Create **more levels**, use parallax backgrounds
* Implement **save/load**, scoring, player stats
* Add **boss fights** or miniboss rooms

## ✅ Tips & Best Practices

* Use **TileMap** for efficient, reusable level design
* Organize **singleton nodes** (AutoLoad) for global game state
* Use **signals** (`body_entered`, etc.) for clean collision handling
* Debug with `print()` or Godot’s **Debugger/Remote** tool
